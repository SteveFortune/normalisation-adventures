#1NF

- Given that relation _R_ has attributes _A[1…n]_ of types _T[1…n]_ respectively, _R_ is in the first normal form if the value for attribute _Ai_ of tuple _t_ in _R_ has the type of _Ti (i=1, … n)_. 
- I.e. all tuples in a relation conform to the relation's heading, by having 1 value of the appropriate type for each attribute of the relation. 
- Every relation is in the first normal form by definition. A relation _R_ is _normalized_ if its in 1NF.
- In theory, an attribute could have a relational type (a _Relational Valued Attribute_).
