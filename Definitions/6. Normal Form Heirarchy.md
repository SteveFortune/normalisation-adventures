#Normal Form Heirarchy


These are the normal forms that I will be covering first:

	1NF
	2NF
	3NF
	BCNF
	4NF
	5NF
	
The higher the level of normalisation, the less update anomalies can occur.

A relvar can be the _nth_ normal form but not in the _(n + 1)st (n = 1, â€¦, 4)_ normal form. I.e. the normal forms are heirarchical: a relvar must be in 1NF to be in 2NF, etc. Saying that a relvar in in 3NF for example, does not necessarily mean that it is in 4NF as well.

If a relvar is in the _nth_ normal form it can always be decomposed via projection (in a nonless way) such that:

- The projected relvars are in the _(n + 1)st_ normal form 

- The the original relvar equals the JOIN of those projected relations (i.e. the projected _(n + 1)st_ NF relations can always be recomposed via JOIN to be in _nth_ normal form)

A 5NF relation is always achieveable. That is, any relation can be decomposed into 5NF projections,
