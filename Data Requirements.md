#Data Requirements


- I want to compare performance of databases in different normal forms.

- The independant variable of this test is the level of normalisation, thus the data requirements driving the design must remain constant.

- Its going to be a bit hit-and-miss because I'm putting an example together for each normal for as I learn it. I don't know what the requiements of higher normal forms are yet so that domain I describe might not be sophisticated enough to be normalised beyond a particular point in the normal form heirarchy.
