#Definitions

This directory will act as a sort-of appendix for various definitions that I come across and feel are important to document (if anything so that I can practice memorising them).

__MITIGATION__

- I'm still learning this stuff, so this information may be inaccurate, simplified, or just wrong. 
- I provide references to online sources where I can but my main reference point is [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Database-Design-Relational-Theory-Practice/dp/1449328016).
- The examples I provide weren't really thought out, they were mainly just for me so that I could get to grips with the various concepts.
- I'm _very_ bad at spelling, soâ€¦ sorry about that.
