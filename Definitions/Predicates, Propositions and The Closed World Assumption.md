#Predicates and Propositions

A predicate is a function that turns true or false based on the values of its variables which may be a set. For example: `Everything in the set {1, 2, 3, 4} is a number between 0 and 5.`

A proposition is a statement which is either true or false based on what the result of a predicate on it is.

Soâ€¦

	P(x)

- `P` is the predicate function
- `x` are the arugments of that function
- Parameters that substitute `x` are the proposition.
- The 'set' defined by the predicate (i.e. all the values of `x` for which `P(x)` is true) is denoted as `{x|P(x)}`


How does this relate to database design? We can take the attributes of a given relvar and use them as the arguments of the predicate. For example:

	A user has a first_name, has a last_name, has an email_address, has an age > 0 and < 100, and a telephone number with 11 numbers in it.
	
Here the relvar `user` represents the above predicate. Here are some propositions for the predicate:

_The predicate would return true for this proposition and thus the data described is a user_

	There is a user with the first_name of 'Ben', last_name of 'Wood', email_address of 'ben.wood@doglet.com', has an age of 19 and has a telephone number of '01453 833527'. 

_This proposition is false because the predicate would return false for it, and thus the data described is not a user_

	There is a user with the first_name of 'George', no last_name, no email_address and a telephone number of '1'. 

So for a given relation, every tuple represents a proposition. 

Finally a relvar's heading define's the _relvar predicate_ of the relvar

#The Closed World Assumption

The closed world assumption presumes that what is currently know is true and what isn't known is false. 

Therefore a given relvar at any given time contains only the tuples that represent true propositions. For example, take a give relation for cups:

__Predicate__: A _cup_ has a _name_, is made of a _material_ and contains a _fluid_.
__Propositions__:

- A cup has a name _tea_cup_ is made of _ceramic_ and contains _tea_
- A cup has a name _glass_ is made of _glass_ and contains _water_
- A cup has a name _mug_ is made of _ceramic_ and contains _coffee_

So we have the following relation `cup(name, material, fluid)`, containing the following tuples: `(tea_cup, ceramic, tea), (glass, glass, water), (mug, ceramic, coffee)`

If we wanted to query this relation to ask whether there are any `cup`s with the name of _mug_ that is made of _metal_ and contains _tea_, by the closed world principal we would get the answer 'no'. 

I.e. if we invoked the predicate for _cup_ with the proposition of a _cup_ with the name of _mug_ that is made of _metal_ and contains _tea_, we would get 'false'.

By the 'open world assumption' we would get the answer "I don't know". None of the tuples in the relation match that particular proposition and because we can't constraint the query to only we what we know, the result is unknown.
