#Candidate Key

- A candidate key is a set of attributes that uniquely identify a tuple. This set may contain only 1 attribute.
- A tuple may have multiple candidate keys.


Here are a few examples covering different cases of candidate keysâ€¦

###Example 1: Single Candidate Key as a Single Attribute

This example demonstrates a relation with a single candidate key. This candidate key is a set of just 1 attrbiute.

- We have a `User` domain
- A `User` has the following attributes: `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`
- `email` uniquely identifies the user
- `email` is the candidate key

###Example 2: Multiple Candidate Keys as Single Attrbiutes

This example demonstrates a relation with 2 candidate keys. These candidate keys are sets that contain just 1 attribute.

- We have a `User` domain
- A `User` has the following attributes: `email`, `username`, `first_name`, `last_name`
- `email` uniquely identifies a user
- `username` also uniquely identifies the user
- The relation has 2 separate candidate keys: `email` and `username`


###Example 3: Single Candidate Key as Multiple Attributes

This example demonstratesa relation with 1 candidate key. The candidate key is a set of 2 attributes that together are a unique pair that identify the relation.

- We have a `User` domain
- A `User` has the following attributes: `first_name`, `last_name`, `date_of_birth`, `telephone`
- In this application, the requirement is that only users with different names will sign up (a bit weird but hey..)
- A combination of `first_name` and `last_name` uniquely identifies a user
- `first_name, last_name` is the only candidate key
