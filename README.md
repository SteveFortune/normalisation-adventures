#Normalisation

This is a personal project documenting examples of database schemas in different normal forms - it is for my own interest.

###Objectives and Requirements

####Normalisation to 6NF

First I want to cover all the normal forms:

- <s>1NF schema & performance benchmarks by Oct 2014</s>
- 2NF schema & performance benchmarks by Oct 2014
- 3NF schema & performance benchmarks by Oct 2014
- BCNF schema & performance benchmarks by Oct 2014
- 4NF schema & performance benchmarks by Nov 2014
- 5NF schema & performance benchmarks by Nov 2014
- 6NF schema & performance benchmarks by Dec 2014

####Denormalised and 'Un-normalised' Comparisons

Then I want to compare benchmarks from the normal forms to benchmarks from schemas that are not normalised

- Denormalised schema & performance benchmarks by Dec 2014. Schema should be taken from 5NF into a denormalised schema.
- 'Un-normalised' schema & performance benchmarks by Dec 2014. Schema should be designed from the ground up to be normalised pragmatically but without specific normalisation constraints in place.

####Benchmarks

Benchmarks should measure:

- Speed of various queries
- DB load testing
- Reports on the amount of anomylous and redundant data there is in the database
