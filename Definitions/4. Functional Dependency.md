#Functional Dependencies

A functional dependency can be expressed as a constraint in a relation R whereby if 2 given tuples U and T have an equal set of attributes A, then another set of attributes B must also be equal for both U and T.

	if U[A1… An] = T[A1… An] then U[B1… Bn] = T[B1… Bn]
	
or

	A → B
