#Functional Dependencies

A functional dependency can be expressed as a constraint in a relation R whereby if 2 given tuples U and T have an equal set of attributes A, then another set of attributes B must also be equal for both U and T.

	if U[A1… An] = T[A1… An] then U[B1… Bn] = T[B1… Bn]
	
or

	A → B

In tutorial D (given that `A` and `B` attributes in relation `R`), a constraint for a functional dependency can be expressed like:

	CONSTRAINT functional_dependency COUNT( R{ A } ) = COUNT( R{ A, B } ) ;

This says that the cardinallity for `A` values across all tuples in `R` is equal to the cardinallity for all `A` and `B` values across all tuples in `R`. I.e. if `A` and `B` were substitued for specific values, the number of times `A` occurs in the body of the relation will be equal to the number of times `A, B` occures in the body of the relation - it is guarenteed that they are functionaly dependent. 

Another way of expressing this constraint in Tutorial D may be:

	CONSTRAINT functional_dependency
		WITH( projection = R{A, B} )
		AND( JOIN( projection, projection RENAME( B, x ) ), B = x )
