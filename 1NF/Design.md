#Design
	
###Notes

I am aiming to design a schema that is _only_ in 1NF (i.e. not in any higher normal form). 

This is _purposefully designed_ have be illogical. This is because the objective is to compare benchmarks of queries run against different schemas in different normal forms; I want to test how a badly designed database that is just in the first normal form, matches up to a database that is in higher normal forms.
