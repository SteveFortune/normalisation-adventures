#Update Anomalies

Redundancy loosely means that one piece of information is represented multiple times, which leads to the possibility of records of the same data that contain disagreeing values.

Example:

	VAR office BASE RELATION
		{ site_name CHAR, site_size INT, address_postcode CHAR, address_line_1 CHAR },
		KEY { site_name } ;
				
Here we cannot:

- insert an address without creating a new office record (__insertion anomaly__)
- delete an office without potentially loosing information about an existing address (__deletion anomaly__)
- update an address without having to update all the same addresses in different offices (__modification anomaly__)

Normalisation removes redundancy thus leaning to a more logical, atomic design.
